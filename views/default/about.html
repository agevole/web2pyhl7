<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>While it works for most applications, {{=response.title}} is a work in progress. In fact we continue to constantly improve it based on users' feedback.</p>
<p>The table structure implements the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/">Health Level 7</a> (HL7)
specifications, but {{=response.title}} does not yet include an implementation of the HL7 communication protocols. This is something we are currently working on.</p>
